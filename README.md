# Quantum Trade Pro

A high-performance trading platform built in C++ designed for low-latency algorithmic trading strategies. Quantum Trade Pro offers institutional-grade execution speeds with a professional UI for strategy development, backtesting, and live trading.

## Features

- **Ultra-low latency execution** optimized for high-frequency trading
- **Advanced order types** including TWAP, VWAP, and iceberg orders
- **Real-time market data processing** with order book visualization
- **Strategy framework** for algorithm development and testing
- **Comprehensive backtesting** with historical data
- **Risk management system** with pre-trade checks and circuit breakers
- **Performance metrics** including latency statistics and execution quality

## Technology Stack

- **C++20**: Core language for high-performance trading system
- **Qt 6.5+**: Cross-platform UI framework for professional trading interface
- **Boost 1.83+**: High-performance containers, lock-free structures, and asynchronous I/O
- **QuantLib**: Financial calculations, options pricing, and risk metrics
- **TA-Lib**: Technical analysis indicators and signal generation
- **QuickFIX**: FIX protocol implementation for market connectivity
- **KDB+/q**: Time-series database for efficient market data storage
- **CMake 3.25+**: Cross-platform build system and dependency management
- **Google Test**: Unit and integration testing framework

## System Architecture

The platform is built around five core components:

1. **Market Data Processing Pipeline**: Handles ingestion and normalization of exchange data
2. **Trading Strategy Engine**: Framework for implementing and testing trading algorithms
3. **Order Execution System**: Manages order lifecycle from creation to execution
4. **Risk Management Framework**: Enforces trading limits and monitors exposures
5. **User Interface Layer**: Provides visualization and control mechanisms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.28+)
- CMake 3.25 or higher
- Qt 6.5 or higher
- Boost 1.83 or higher

### Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-trade-pro.git
cd quantum-trade-pro

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run the application
./bin/QuantumTradePro
```

## Usage

### Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the application directory:

```
{
  "exchange": {
    "name": "binance",
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "secret_key": "your_secret_key"
  },
  "risk": {
    "max_position_size": 100000,
    "max_drawdown": 5000,
    "circuit_breaker_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Trading Strategies

Implement your strategy by extending the Strategy base class:

```
class MovingAverageCrossover : public Strategy {
public:
    void initialize() override;
    Signal generateSignal(const MarketData& data) override;
    void onExecution(const ExecutionReport& report) override;
};
```

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Project setup and core architecture
- [x] Market data processing implementation
- [x] Basic UI development
- [x] Strategy engine framework
- [ ] Order management system
- [ ] Risk management framework
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Exchange connectivity
- [ ] Testing and deployment

## Performance Considerations

Quantum Trade Pro is designed with performance as a primary goal:

- **Lock-free data structures** for inter-thread communication
- **Custom memory allocators** to minimize allocation overhead
- **SIMD optimizations** for vector processing
- **Cache-friendly data layouts** to minimize CPU cache misses
- **Thread affinity** to reduce context switching

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
cd build
ctest -V
```
