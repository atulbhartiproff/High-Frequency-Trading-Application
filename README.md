# High-Frequency Trading Application

High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Application is a C++-based framework designed to execute algorithmic trading strategies with minimal latency. It provides modules for market data processing, order management, risk control, and strategy execution, making it a solid foundation for developing and testing HFT strategies in real-time financial markets.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Market Data Processing**: Efficient handling and processing of streaming market data.
* **Exchange API Integration**: Facilitates connectivity to various exchange APIs.
* **Order Management**: Handles order creation, submission, and tracking.
* **Risk Management**: Monitors trading activities to mitigate risks.
* **Strategy Execution**: Framework to implement and test algorithmic trading strategies.
* **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to benchmark and monitor system performance.
